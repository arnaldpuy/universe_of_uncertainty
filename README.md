# Global sensitivity analysis can unveil the hidden universe of uncertainty in multiverse studies

This is the ``R`` code of the manuscript, whose abstract reads as follows:

*A wave of recent many-analysts studies struggle to explain ``hidden uncertainty" in their results. We propose global sensitivity analysis (GSA) as a method to plan for and better understand this uncertainty in many-analysts studies. GSA allows us to understand in the first place how much uncertainty we are likely to find and be able to explain. Thus it provides a method to pre-determine what can be gained from a study that otherwise carries high human capital if not financial costs. GSA is a major improvement on multiverse analysis because it (i) uses state of the art sampling strategies to explore the space of the modelling options and (ii) decomposes variance in results by single and higher order modelling choices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GSA by replicating the many-analysts study by Breznau, Rinke and Wuttke et al., which involved 161 researchers in 73 teams and hoped to shed light on how immigration might impact public preferences for social policy. We explain most of the uncertainty they could not, but only via unique interactions of model specifications. No matter how many teams they gathered, they would not have found single modelling choices that mattered for the outcome, and this has strong implications for whether such a study should be run in the first place, in addition to interpretation of results.*

## The code

Here we provide the code of the analysis and a comprehensive explanation of the workflow required to conduct many-analyst studyies in sillico in `.R`, `.rmd` and `.pdf`. We also provide the dataset compiled by Breznau et al. 2022 for full replication of the analysis.
